players are able to roll as many times as they want.
-also, can we only display the board after a move has been made, or improvement has been bought
    (ie.  not after 'assets' or 'menu' have been called)






There '-load' command line input works, and 'saveFile2' is a sample load file.  I havent implemented loading players, board.cc expects a function Player::loadPlayer(string), I can write it but I havent really looked at the Player class at all.

Warning:  the rest of Board.cc is kind of a mess though, so be warned.

The makefile makes an executable 'testâ€™.
 
Also, init.txt is for initializes the cells for a new game.
